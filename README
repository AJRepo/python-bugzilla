This is a python module that provides a nice, python-ish interface to Bugzilla
over XMLRPC.

Currently it targets Red Hat's xmlrpc services, because:
a) That's what the Fedora project uses, and
b) Even if it is ugly, it's got more methods than the Bugzilla 3.0 API

In the near future (see TODO) we may support the Bugzilla 3.0 API, although
it probably won't not support all the same methods as the RHBugzilla class.

In the long-term future, Red Hat is planning on porting their interfaces to
the Bugzilla 3.0 framework and contributing them to upstream Bugzilla, so in
time we may drop the Red Hat implementation in favor of one unified Bugzilla
interface. Won't that be nice?

Comments, suggestions, and - most of all - patches are welcomed and encouraged.

Enjoy.
