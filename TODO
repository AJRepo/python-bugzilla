For 0.4:
- Fix up selftest.py
- actually install the man page

For 0.5:
- make Bugzilla methods all take a bug ID list
  - BZ 3 methods all take idlist
  - RHBZ can use multicall to emulate that

Someday:
- better documentation for abstract methods in BugzillaBase
- more consistent calls for abstract methods
- make the abstract methods return stuff closer to Bugzilla3's return values
- auto-generate the man page
- Document the 0.x API as it stands
- Work on a cleaner 1.x API
